<p class="about-me">The Cozy Tavern's story began in 1880 when it was established by our great-great-grandfather, the legendary baker, Barnaby "Barnie" Hawthorne. Barnie envisioned more than just a place to sell his famous wares; he wanted to create a genuine family havenâ€”a sturdy, dependable spot where neighbors could always find comfort and good company through changing times. For over a century, our family has proudly maintained Barnie's original commitment to quality, ensuring the Cozy Tavern remains a faithful tribute to timeless hospitality and cherished moments.
